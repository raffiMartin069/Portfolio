# Personal Portfolio

  Hi I am Raf! As part of my Web Development Journey I have created a simple Portfolio using **HTML and CSS only** .
I believe that this is my stepping stone towards the journey of being a Developer.
I tried to make it simple yet responsive. Lapses might be found to this website however,
I would do further refactorings and updates to mantain and beutify this. 

Cheers!
